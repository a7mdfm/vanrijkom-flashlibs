  * Open Terminal
  * Navigate to the directory where you placed {{{far}}}
  * Issue {{{sudo ln far /usr/bin/far}}}
  * Change to another directory and issue {{{far}}}. Far's help text will be printed to screen.

== Windows XP ==
  * Start
  * Right-click {{{My Computer}}}
  * Select {{{properties}}}
  * Select {{{advanced}}}
  * Click {{{Environment Variables}}}
  * Select the 'path' system variable
  * Click {{{Edit}}}
  * append {{{;your\directory\containing\far.exe}}} at the end of the text shown at {{{variable value}}}. Do *not* include {{{far.exe}}} - enter only the directory {{{far.exe}}} resides in
  * Close all property windows, (re)start a command line prompt and issue {{{far.exe}}}. Far's help text will be printed to screen.
